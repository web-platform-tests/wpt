// Navigating a fenced frame to a page with a COOP mismatch (in this case,
// unsafe-none -> same-origin-allow-popups) will force the page into a new
// browsing context group.
//
// In Chromium, this forces using a "speculative" frame host which initializes
// the new frame using a different path than normal.
//
// This test is a basic smoke test that sending input through this setup works
// and doesn't cause any crashes. See linked bug for more details.
//
// TODO(https://crbug.com/1411599): COOP is no longer taken into account inside
// fenced frames. To test the "speculative" frame host route, we might only need
// to do a cross-site navigation. Once figured out, use the new approach to test
// that route.
