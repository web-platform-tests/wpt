desc: Update the ICE gathering state
steps:
  - status: trivial
    desc: >
      To update the ICE gathering state of an RTCPeerConnection instance
      connection, the user agent MUST queue a task that runs the following steps
    steps:
      - step: 1
        status: untestable
        desc: >
          If connection's [[IsClosed]] slot is true, abort these steps.

      - step: 2
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-iceGatheringState
        desc: >
          Let newState be the value of deriving a new state value as described
          by the RTCIceGatheringState enum.


      - step: 3
        status: untestable
        desc: >
          If connection's ICE gathering state is equal to newState, abort these
          steps.

      - step: 4
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-iceGatheringState
        desc: >
          Set connection's ice gathering state to newState.

      - step: 5
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-iceGatheringState
        desc: >
          Fire a simple event named icegatheringstatechange at connection.

      - step: 6
        status: todo
        desc: >
          If newState is "completed", fire an ice candidate event named
          icecandidate with null at connection.
