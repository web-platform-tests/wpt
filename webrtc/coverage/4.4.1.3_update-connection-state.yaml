desc: Update the connection state
steps:
  - status: untestable
    desc: >
      An RTCPeerConnection object has an aggregated connection state. Whenever
      the state of an RTCDtlsTransport or RTCIceTransport changes or when the
      [[IsClosed]] slot turns true, the user agent MUST update the connection
      state by queueing a task that runs the following steps
    steps:
      - step: 1
        status: trivial
        desc: >
          Let connection be this RTCPeerConnection object.

      - step: 2
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-connectionState
        desc: >
          Let newState be the value of deriving a new state value as described by
          the RTCPeerConnectionState enum.

      - step: 3
        status: untestable
        desc: >
          If connection's connection state is equal to newState, abort these steps.

      - step: 4
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-connectionState
        desc: >
          Let connection's connection state be newState.

      - step: 5
        status: tested
        files:
          - RTCPeerConnection-connectionState
        desc: >
          Fire a simple event named connectionstatechange at connection.
