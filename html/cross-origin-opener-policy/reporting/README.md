## Testing plan ##



- access-reporting
  - Test properties that are handled by CrossOriginPropertyFallback ( P ) in the spec, should not send reports.
    tests: https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/pull/28653
- navigation-reporting
  - report-only-same-origin-with-coep.https.html is identical to report-only-same-origin-with-coep-report-only.https.html (but different .headers) -- could have clearer titles.

- test step 3. Come up with interesting cases where virtual browsing context group ID has unexpected values.
