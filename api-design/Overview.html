        This document captures best practices in designing APIs that fit well into the Web platform as
        a whole, using WebIDL [[!WEBIDL]].

        As it currently stands, this document is nothing more than a proposal from its editor, with no
        backing implied or otherwise from any other party.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Over a relatively short period of time the number of different APIs being created for use on the
        Web has grown at a sustained pace. In working on these interfaces, many in the community discuss
        the benefits of certain approaches over others and reach agreement as to best practices when
        facing a given problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keeping track of all these gems is however difficult given the volume of work being carried on
        in parallel and the sometimes disjointed nature of the groups involved. As a result, it can take
        a long while and many arguments repeated almost identically before a discovered best practice
        becomes common.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this document is to capture such ideas as they appear and accrete them over time so as
        to constitute a repository of knowledge on this topic. As a guide it does not however endeavour to
        supplant editors' brains in making decisions as to how to design their APIs, and consequently one
        must keep in mind that the reasoning behind a specific recommendation is often more important than
        its result. Furthermore, in some cases there may not be a single consensual best approach, and 
        editors will need to understand the tradeoffs involved in order to pick what works for them amongst
        a set of options.

    <h2>Exception    </h2>
    <p>Web IDL forbids exception fields named "message" (and "name"). This 
      property will exist automatically as an own property on the exception 
      object if a message is specified when throwing the exception. So you 
      just need to say, for example.</p>

    <p>Throw an FooException of type "SomeError" with message "Something went wrong!". </span></p>
