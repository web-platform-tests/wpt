 <!--
  In more detail, what this test is trying to verify is that the final <li>
  element inherits the counter from its parent and the counter-value also
  comes from its parent, not its previous sibling.

  Specifically, referencing https://drafts.csswg.org/css-lists-3/#inheriting-counters

  * step 3 requires that the counter inherited by the final <li>
    is from the parent, not the previous sibling
  * step 4 requires that the value for that counter is taken from the parent,
    as it has a different creator from the counter in the previous step.

  The values should be: 0, 0.1, 0.2, 1
