csswg-test has moved
====================

As of 28 March 2017, this repo is no more. RIP, csswg-test.

It has now been merged into [web-platform-tests][] and all tests formally in
this repository can be found in the `css` subdirectory.

Issues and pull requests on this repository are kept for historical interest
only; no new issues should be opened: they will be as heard as a tree falling
in a abandoned forest. They will all be moved over in the coming week to
web-platform-tests and closed.

If you have an existing pull request open here, feel free to push new changes
to it until it is moved and closed. If you were about to open a pull request
here, [rebase it onto web-platform-tests][moving-old-branches]) and open it
there.
