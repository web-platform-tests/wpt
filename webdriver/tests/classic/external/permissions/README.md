# WebDriver Permissions API Tests

This directory contains tests for the WebDriver Permissions API automation
capabilities as defined in the W3C Permissions specification:

https://www.w3.org/TR/permissions/#automation-webdriver

## Overview

The Permissions API allows web applications to query the status of
permissions (e.g., geolocation, notifications, camera, microphone).
WebDriver extends this with automation capabilities that allow tests
to set and query permission states programmatically, enabling automated
testing of permission-dependent features without user interaction.
