This library adheres to `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`_.

**5.6.5** (2024-10-09)

- Published binary wheels for Python 3.13

**5.6.4** (2024-06-06)

- Fixed decoding of epoch-based dates being affected by the local time zone in the C extension

**5.6.2** (2024-02-19)

- Fixed ``__hash__()`` of the C version of the ``CBORTag`` type crashing when there's a recursive
  reference cycle
- Fixed type annotation for the file object in ``cbor2.dump()``, ``cbor2.load()``, ``CBOREncoder``
  and ``CBORDecoder`` to be ``IO[bytes]`` instead of ``BytesIO``
- Worked around a `CPython bug <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99612>`_ that caused
  a ``SystemError`` to be raised, or even a buffer overflow to occur when decoding a long text
  string that contained only ASCII characters
- Changed the return type annotations of ``cbor2.load()`` and ``cbor2.load()`` to return ``Any``
  instead of ``object`` so as not to force users to make type casts

**5.6.1** (2024-02-01)

- Fixed use-after-free in the decoder's C version when prematurely encountering the end of stream
- Fixed the C version of the decoder improperly raising ``CBORDecodeEOF`` when decoding a text

- Added the ``cbor2`` command line tool (for ``pipx run cbor2``)
- Added support for native date encoding (bschoenmaeckers)
- Made the C extension mandatory when the environment variable ``CBOR2_BUILD_C_EXTENSION`` is set
  to ``1``.
- Fixed ``SystemError`` in the C extension when decoding a ``Fractional`` with a bad
  number of arguments or a non-tuple value
- Fixed ``SystemError`` in the C extension when the decoder object hook raises an
  exception
- Fixed a segmentation fault when decoding invalid unicode data
- Fixed infinite recursion when trying to hash a CBOR tag whose value points to the tag
  itself

  large) are being decoded

  ``CBORDecodeValueError``
- Fixed ``TypeError`` from a failed decoding of ``MIMEMessage`` not being wrapped as
  ``CBORDecodeValueError``

  ``datetime`` not being wrapped as ``CBORDecodeValueError``

**5.5.1** (2023-11-02)

- Fixed ``CBORSimpleValue`` allowing the use of reserved values (24 to 31) which resulted in
  invalid byte sequences

**5.5.0** (2023-10-21)

- The ``cbor2.encoder``, ``cbor2.decoder`` or ``cbor2.types`` modules were deprecated – import

- Added support for Python 3.12
- Added type annotations
- Dropped support for Python 3.7

**5.1.0** (2020-03-18)

- Minor API change: ``CBORSimpleValue`` is now a subclass of namedtuple and allows
  all numeric comparisons. This brings functional parity between C and Python modules.
- Fixes for C-module on big-endian systems including floating point decoding, smallint encoding,
  and boolean argument handling. Tested on s390x and MIPS32.
- Increase version requred of setuptools during install due to unicode errors.

**5.0.1** (2020-01-21)

- Fix deprecation warning on python 3.7, 3.8 (mariano54)
- Minor documentation tweaks

**5.0.0** (2020-01-20)

- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** CBOR does not have a bare DATE type, encoding dates as datetimes
  is disabled by default (PR by Changaco)
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** ``CBORDecoder.set_shareable()`` only takes the instance to share, not
  the shareable's index
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** ``CBORError`` now descends from ``Exception`` rather than
  ``ValueError``; however, subordinate exceptions now descend from ``ValueError`` (where
  appropriate) so most users should notice no difference
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** ``CBORDecoder`` can now raise ``CBORDecodeEOF`` which inherits
  from ``EOFError`` supporting streaming applications
- Optional Pure C implementation by waveform80 that functions identically to the pure Python
  implementation with further contributions from: toravir, jonashoechst, Changaco
- Drop Python 3.3 and 3.4 support from the build process; they should still work if built from
  source but are no longer officially supported
- Added support for encoding and decoding ``ipaddress.IPv4Address``,
  ``ipaddress.IPv6Address``, ``ipaddress.IPv4Network``, and ``ipaddress.IPv6Network``
  (semantic tags 260 and 261)

**4.2.0** (2020-01-10)

- **BROKEN BUILD** Removed

**4.1.2** (2018-12-10)

- Fixed bigint encoding taking quadratic time
- Fixed overflow errors when encoding floating point numbers in canonical mode
- Improved decoder performance for dictionaries
- Minor documentation tweaks

**4.1.1** (2018-10-14)

**4.1.0** (2018-05-27)

- Added canonical encoding (via ``canonical=True``) (PR by Sekenre)
- Added support for encoding/decoding sets (semantic tag 258) (PR by Sekenre)
- Added support for encoding ``FrozenDict`` (hashable dict) as map keys or set elements (PR by
  Sekenre)

**4.0.1** (2017-08-21)

- Fixed silent truncation of decoded data if there are not enough bytes in the stream for an exact
  read (``CBORDecodeError`` is now raised instead)

**4.0.0** (2017-04-24)

- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Value sharing has been disabled by default, for better compatibility
  with other implementations and better performance (since it is rarely needed)
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Replaced the ``semantic_decoders`` decoder option with the
  ``CBORDecoder.tag_hook`` option
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Replaced the ``encoders`` encoder option with the
  ``CBOREncoder.default`` option
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Factored out the file object argument (``fp``) from all callbacks
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** The encoder no longer supports every imaginable type implementing the
  ``Sequence`` or ``Map`` interface, as they turned out to be too broad
- Added the ``CBORDecoder.object_hook`` option for decoding dicts into complex objects (intended
  for situations where JSON compatibility is required and semantic tags cannot be used)
- Added encoding and decoding of simple values (``CBORSimpleValue``) (contributed by Jerry
  Lundström)
- Replaced the decoder for bignums with a simpler and faster version (contributed by orent)
- Made all relevant classes and functions available directly in the ``cbor2`` namespace
- Added proper documentation

- Fixed TypeError when trying to encode extension types (regression introduced in 3.0.3)

**3.0.3** (2016-09-23)

**3.0.2** (2016-09-23)

- Fixed decoding failure for datetimes with microseconds (tag 0)

**3.0.1** (2016-08-08)

- Fixed error in the cyclic structure detection code that could mistake one container for
  another, sometimes causing a bogus error about cyclic data structures where there was none

**3.0.0** (2016-07-03)

- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Encoder callbacks now receive three arguments: the encoder instance,
  the value to encode and a file-like object. The callback must must now either write directly to
  the file-like object or call another encoder callback instead of returning an iterable.
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Semantic decoder callbacks now receive four arguments: the decoder
  instance, the primitive value, a file-like object and the shareable index for the decoded value.
  Decoders that support value sharing must now set the raw value at the given index in
  ``decoder.shareables``.
- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed support for iterative encoding (``CBOREncoder.encode()`` is no
  longer a generator function and always returns ``None``)
- Significantly improved performance (encoder ~30 % faster, decoder ~60 % faster)
- Fixed serialization round-trip for ``undefined`` (simple type 23)
- Added proper support for value sharing in callbacks

**2.0.0** (2016-06-11)

- **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Deserialize unknown tags as ``CBORTag`` objects so as not to lose
  information
