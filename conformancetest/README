To generate data.js (this will only work if you're me unless you hack the
source code):

1) Visit gentest.html in both Gecko and WebKit.  Enter the secret password and
click the button to submit.

2) Once both are done submitting, run conformancetest/fixdata.  If it reports
any discrepancies, update conformancetest/diff *and* (if appropriate)
conformancetest/patch.  Do not forget to update conformancetest/patch, or else
stuff will get messed up.

XXX This is no longer true now that data.js is split up.
