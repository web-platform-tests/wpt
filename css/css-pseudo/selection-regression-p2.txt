Based on P2 in the description for <https://crrev.com/915543>, ideally
we would also verify that originating line-through decorations always
paint over text, even in selected parts.

Unfortunately, originating decoration recoloring (when correctly
implemented) essentially makes it impossible to tell whether the text
or the decoration was painted on top.

Some ways this test could become possible:

•   Wider impl support for ::target-text or ::highlight decorations.
    Decorations introduced by highlight pseudos aren’t recolored, so
    we could move the originating text-decoration to any highlight
    that paints under ::selection (currently all of them), choose
    another ::selection color, and check which is painted on top.

•   SVG adds support for text-decoration-color, or HTML adds support
    for stroke and stroke-width via CSS, as long as we continue to
    recolor originating decorations to color only. Then we could
    stroke in another color, and check which is painted on top.

*   css-pseudo adds some kind of support for suppressing or otherwise
    tweaking the recoloring of originating decorations.

*   Some other standard means for text to contain colors other than
    the color property, such as color fonts.
