# WebDriver specification tests

Herein lies a set of conformance tests
for the W3C web browser automation specification
known as [WebDriver](http://w3c.github.io/webdriver/webdriver-spec.html).
The purpose of these tests is determine implementation compliance
so that different driver implementations can determine
whether they meet the recognised standard.
